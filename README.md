Boris Bikes
===========

Simple application that uses OOP and TDD principles.

This branch is for london style TDD, where symbols and doubles are being used to test as opposed to real objects.

The latter means that my thought processes do not have to be interupted i.e. I dont have to stop what I am doing and create an object before I can use it.

How to use
----------

Open `irb` and `require` files of classes that you plan to use.

For example:

```
require './lib/bike'
```

Boris Bikes
===========

Simple application that uses OOP and TDD principles.

This branch is for chicago style TDD, where real objects are being used to
test as opposed to symbols and doubles.

The latter means that my thought processes have to be interupted i.e.
I have to stop what I am doing and create an object before I can use it.

How to use
----------

Open `irb` and `require` files of classes that you plan to use.

For example:

```
require './lib/bike'
```

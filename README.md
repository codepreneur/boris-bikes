===========

Week 3 project @ Makers Academy.

Simple application that uses OOP and TDD principles.

The goal of this project was to introduce us to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and show us the very basics of Object-Oriented Design (OOD).

This branch is for chicago style TDD.

Brief Description
-----------------

We creating a simple system for managing Boris Bikes in London. Our system keeps track of a number of docking stations and the bikes. It allows us to rent the bikes and return them. Occasionally the bikes will break and then they will be unavailable for rental. There will also be a garage to fix the bikes and a van to move the bikes between the stations and the garage.
